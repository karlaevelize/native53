## Native App vs Cross Platform

**iOS native:** Objective-C and Swift

**Android native:** Java and Kotlin

**Hybrid/Cross platform:** React Native and Kotlin

### Native App Benefits

- Better performance and commpatibility
- App bundle is smaller/lighter

### Hybrid/Cross platform Benefits

- Easier to code if you know JS
- No need to hire different developers (iOS and Android developers)
- The company can use their frontend developers for the task
- Cheaper

## Main differences between React and React Native

1. Phones don’t understand HTML (browsers do) so we don’t use HTML tags, we have components that substitute them 

2. Routing. Why? URLs aren’t a thing so attaching a screen/component to one doesn’t make sense. We have a substitute called navigators.
